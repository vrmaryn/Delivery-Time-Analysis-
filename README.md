# DELIVEREASE: PREDICTING DELIVERY TIMES WITH DATA

## 📌 Overview
DeliverEase is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and predicting delivery times using real-world logistics data. This project involves comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors affecting delivery durations, followed by the application of **predictive machine learning models** to estimate delivery times accurately.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the variables contributing to delivery delays
- Perform EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers
- Build predictive models to estimate delivery times
- Provide insights to help optimize logistics and delivery operations

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Specify source or mention "synthetic dataset created for analysis"]
- **Features Include**:
  - Order ID
  - Delivery Status
  - Order Date & Time
  - Shipment Mode (Air, Surface, etc.)
  - Delivery Distance
  - Weather Conditions
  - City / Region
  - Delivery Time (Target variable) and many more

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling
- **Collab Notebook** for development and testing

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Null value treatment and data cleaning
- Feature correlation and statistical summaries
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, pairplots)
- Trend analysis (delivery time vs distance, city, mode, etc.)

---

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- **Regression Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Model Evaluation Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - R² Score

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Longer distances and adverse weather significantly impact delivery time
- Air shipments tend to be faster and more consistent
- The Random Forest model yielded the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE

---

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **RMSE**: 
- **R² Score**

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integrate live traffic or weather APIs for real-time prediction
- Build a web-based dashboard for delivery managers
- Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning

---

## 💡 Conclusion
DeliverEase helps logistics companies make informed decisions by providing accurate delivery time predictions and actionable insights from historical data. It demonstrates the power of data science in optimizing operational efficiency.
